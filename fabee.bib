  abstract = {The mammalian eye is a remarkable optical device, but its design is
	not perfect. The blood vessels that supply the inner retina are located
	in front of the photoreceptor layer, blocking access to light. Their
	shadows create a pattern of blindness in the field of vision that
	corresponds precisely to the location of the largest vessels in the
	eye. We show here that in squirrel monkeys, focal deprivation by
	blood vessels leads to rewiring of the eye's geniculocortical projections,
	imprinting an image of the retinal vascular tree onto the primary
	visual cortex. This process illustrates vividly that local imbalances
	in neuronal activity can influence column formation during normal
	development.},

  abstract = {In bats and technological sonars, the gain of the receiver is progressively
	increased with time after the transmission of a signal to compensate
	for acoustic propagation loss. The current understanding of dolphin
	echolocation indicates that automatic gain control is not a part
	of their sonar system. In order to test this understanding, we have
	performed field measurements of free-ranging echolocating dolphins.
	Here we show that dolphins do possess an automatic gain control mechanism,
	but that it is implemented in the transmission phase rather than
	the receiving phase of a sonar cycle. We find that the amplitude
	of the dolphins' echolocation signals are highly range dependent;
	this amplitude increases with increasing target range, R, in a 20
	log(R) fashion to compensate for propagation loss. If the echolocation
	target is a fish school with many sound scatterers, the echoes from
	the school will remain nearly constant with range as the dolphin
	closes in on it. This characteristic has the same effect as time-varying
	gain in bats and technological sonar when considered from a sonar
	system perspective.},

	A series of hundreds of repetitive saccades in the same direction

	(1) The cerebellar cortex is constantly recalibrating the saccadic

	might be caused by muscle fatigue. (2) A mechanism capable of slow
	recovery from dysmetria is revealed despite the permanent absence

  abstract = {We investigated why self-produced tactile stimulation is perceived
	as less intense than the same stimulus produced externally. A tactile
	stimulus on the palm of the right hand was either externally produced,
	by a robot or self-produced by the subject. In the conditions in
	which the tactile stimulus was self-produced, subjects moved the
	arm of a robot with their left hand to produce the tactile stimulus
	on their right hand via a second robot. Subjects were asked to rate
	intensity of the tactile sensation and consistently rated self-produced
	tactile stimuli as less tickly, intense, and pleasant than externally
	produced tactile stimuli. Using this robotic setup we were able to
	manipulate the correspondence between the action of the subjects'
	left hand and the tactile stimulus on their right hand. First, we
	parametrically varied the delay between the movement of the left
	hand and the resultant movement of the tactile stimulus on the right
	hand. Second, we implemented varying degrees of trajectory perturbation
	and varied the direction of the tactile stimulus movement as a function
	of the direction of left-hand movement. The tickliness rating increased
	significantly with increasing delay and trajectory perturbation.
	This suggests that self-produced movements attenuate the resultant
	tactile sensation and that a necessary requirement of this attenuation
	is that the tactile stimulus and its causal motor command correspond
	in time and space. We propose that the extent to which self-produced
	tactile sensation is attenuated (i.e., its tickliness) is proportional
	to the error between the sensory feedback predicted by an internal
	forward model of the motor system and the actual sensory feedback
	produced by the movement.},

	analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they
	are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically
	implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which
	is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data.
	We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite)
	VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial
	and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension
	would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while
	at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization
	performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which
	support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results
	of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also
	presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key
	theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will
	find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

	first-order motion) is an important and well-examined function of
	the visual system. It can be explained, for example, by the operation
	of elementary motion detectors (EMDs), which cross-correlate the
	spatiotemporal luminance distribution. More recent studies using
	second-order motion stimuli, i.e., shifts of the distribution of
	features such as contrast, texture, flicker, or motion, extended
	classic concepts of motion perception by including nonlinear or hierarchical
	processing in the EMD. Smooth-pursuit eye movements can be used as
	a direct behavioral probe for motion processing. The ability of the
	visual system to extract motion signals from the spatiotemporal changes
	of the retinal image can be addressed by analyzing the elicited eye
	movements. We measured the eye movement response to moving objects
	defined by two different types of first-order motion and two different
	types of second-order motion. Our results clearly showed that the
	direction of smooth-pursuit eye movements was always determined by
	the direction of object motion. In particular, in the case of second-order
	motion stimuli, smooth-pursuit did not follow the retinal image motion.
	The latency of the initial saccades during pursuit of second-order
	stimuli was slightly but significantly increased, compared with the
	latency of saccades elicited by first-order motion. The processing
	of second-order motion in the peripheral visual field was less exact
	than the processing of first-order motion in the peripheral field.
	Steady state smooth-pursuit eye speed did not reflect the velocity
	of second-order motion as precisely as that of first-order motion,
	and the resulting retinal error was compensated by saccades. Interestingly,
	for slow second-order stimuli we observed that the eye could move
	faster than the target, leading to small, corrective saccades in
	the opposite direction to the ongoing smooth-pursuit eye movement.
	We conclude from our results that both visual perception and the
	control of smooth-pursuit eye movements have access to processing
	mechanisms extracting first- and second-order motion.},

	GABA(A) receptors and then AMPA receptors, before NMDA receptors
	appeared in radially migrating neurons. Spontaneous synaptic activity
	emerged soon after migration was complete, and spiking activity was
	the last characteristic to be acquired. This delayed excitability
	is unique to cells born in the adult and may protect circuits from
	uncontrolled neurotransmitter release and neural network disruption.
	Our results show that newly born cells recruited into the olfactory
	bulb become neurons, and a unique sequence of events leads to their

	the background is a necessary first step. This segregation can be
	achieved by detection of differences in the spatial, temporal and
	spatio-temporal properties of the object and background. Here we
	investigate how flicker influences the perception of a moving object
	in man and monkey, and we examine the neuronal responses in extrastriate
	medial temporal and medial superior temporal areas (MT and MST) of
	two rhesus monkeys. The performance of humans and monkeys in a direction
	discrimination task was impaired in the presence of flicker in the
	background compared to the static background condition. A similar
	effect was found in recordings from 155 single units in areas MT
	and MST during the discrimination task. The discriminability (d')
	of the neuronal responses in preferred and nonpreferred directions
	was reduced by 33% on average in the presence of a flicker background
	compared to the static background. This reduction in discriminability
	was not caused by differences in variance of the neuronal activity
	for the two background conditions, but was due to a reduction of
	the difference between the activities in preferred and nonpreferred
	direction. This reduction in directional selectivity could be traced
	back to two different mechanisms: in 32 out of 155 neurons (21%),
	the decrease resulted from an increase in the response to the stimulus
	moving in the nonpreferred direction; in 62 out of 155 neurons (40%),
	the reduction in directional selectivity was due to a decrease in
	the response to the preferred direction. These results give deeper
	insights into how moving stimuli are processed in the presence of

	involving moving stimuli defined by either first- or second-order

	motion consisting of a rectangular field of stationary dots and theta
	motion consisting of the same rectangular field with dots moving
	in the direction opposite to that of the object. The two types of
	stimuli involved different segmentation cues between the moving object
	and the background: temporal structure of the luminance (flicker)
	in the case of drift-balanced motion and opposed motion in the case
	of the theta-motion stimulus. Our monkeys were able to correctly
	report the direction of each stimulus. Single-unit recordings from
	the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas
	revealed that 16 out of 38 neurons (41%) from area MT and 34 out
	of 68 neurons (50%) from area MST responded in a directionally selective
	manner to the drift-balanced stimulus. The movement of an object
	defined by theta motion is not explicitly encoded in the neuronal
	activity in areas MT or MST. Our results do not support the hypothesis
	that the neuronal activity in these areas codes for the direction
	of stimulus movement independent of specific stimulus parameters.
	Furthermore, our results emphasize the relevance of different segmentation

  abstract = {he explicit determination of maximum likelihood estimates for the
	conditional probabilities of the nodes of a discrete Bayesian network
	using imcomplete data is usually not possible, and iterative methods
	are normally required, for example the EM algorithm or Gibbs sampling.
	However such methods can be slow to converge. We present an alternative
	approach to estimating such probabilities, which uses an entropy
	maximization procedure to incorporate information regarding the nature
	of the missing data mechanism. If such information can be expressed
	by linear equalities, of a nature elaborated below, then explicit
	point estimates can usually be found. When data are missing at random,
	the solution is equivalent to that obtained by the EM algorithm.
	This paper concentrates on the principle of obtaining point estimates
	for the probabilities. A companion paper (Cowell 1999b) develops
	a Bayesian version of the method suitable for learning in Bayesian

	motion of a moving luminous dot on a computer display to body-fixed

	a dark room. Accuracy of aligning dot motion to earth-fixed vertical,
	a displayed luminous line (external visual axis) of varied orientations,
	and head and trunk longitudinal axes was tested in one experiment
	with the display in the vertical frontal plane. In a second experiment,
	dot motion was aligned to head and trunk anterior/posterior (A-P)
	axes and to an external visual axis presented on a horizontal computer
	screen. Head and trunk orientations were varied in the frontal plane
	(left/right tilt) when testing vertical plane axes and by rotation
	of the head and/or trunk about a vertical axis when testing horizontal
	plane axes. Perceptual errors were lowest when aligning to earth-fixed
	vertical in the vertical plane and to an external oblique line in
	the horizontal plane when head and trunk orientations were varied.
	Perceptions of horizontal plane motion direction were accurate relative
	to the trunk-fixed A-P axis when only head orientation was varied,
	but large errors were made when trunk orientation was varied. Proprioceptive
	influences on visual perceptions of motion direction were shown by
	a dependence of perceptual errors on trunk and neck orientations
	when aligning to all axes. Furthermore, when aligning motion to an
	external line, the errors depended on orientation of the line in
	addition to trunk and neck orientations, but not when aligning to
	intrinsic axes or earth-fixed vertical in the presence of an external
	line. We conclude that the visual motion system defines direction
	relative to earth-fixed vertical and an external horizontal reference
	axis when available. The trunk-fixed A-P axis can be used to accurately
	define motion direction when operating without an external reference
	if a neutral trunk orientation is maintained.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now enables precise visualization
	of the mechanical state of the living human orbit. Resulting insights
	have motivated histological re-examination of human and simian orbits,
	providing abundant consistent evidence for the active pulley hypothesis,
	a re-formulation of ocular motor physiology. Each extraocular muscle
	(EOM) consists of a global layer (GL) contiguous with the tendon
	and inserting on the eyeball, and a similar-sized orbital layer (OL)
	inserting on a connective tissue ring forming the EOM pulley. The
	pulley controls the EOM path and serves as the EOM's functional origin.
	Activity of the OL positions the pulley along each rectus EOM to
	assure that its pulling direction shifts by half the change in ocular
	orientation, the half-angle behavior characteristic of a linear ocular
	motor plant. Half-angle behavior is equivalent to Listing's law of
	ocular torsion, and makes 3-D ocular rotations effectively commutative.
	Pulleys are configured to maintain oblique EOM paths orthogonal to
	half-angle behavior, and violate Listing's law during the vestibulo-ocular
	reflex. Rectus pulley positions shift during convergence, facilitating
	stereopsis. Innervations, fiber types, and metabolism of the OL and
	GL differ, consistent with the elastic loading of the former, and
	viscous loading of the latter. Disorders of the location and stability
	of rectus pulleys are associated with predictable patterns of incomitant
	strabismus that may mimic cranial nerve palsies. Surgical interventions
	improve defective pulley function. Understanding of ocular motor
	control requires characterization of the behavior of the EOM pulleys
	as well as knowledge of angular eye orientation.},

	strongly criticized by several authors (e.g., Schaffer, 1993; Webb,

	interpreted in two quite different ways. The first interpretation
	(simplicity is a goal in itself) is essentially correct, but is at
	heart a preference for more comprehensible models. The second interpretation
	(simplicity leads to greater accuracy) is much more problematic.
	A critical review of the theoretical arguments for and against it
	shows that it is unfounded as a universal principle, and demonstrably
	false. A review of empirical evidence shows that it also fails as
	a practical heuristic. This article argues that its continued use

	electrolocation electric fish can measure the distance of most objects
	accurately, independently of size, shape and material. Measurements
	of the 'electric image' projected onto the skin surface during electrolocation
	revealed only one parameter combination that was unambiguously related
	to object distance: the ratio between maximal image slope and maximal
	image amplitude. However, slope-to-amplitude ratios for spheres were
	always smaller than those for other objects. As predicted, these
	objects were erroneously judged by the fish to be further away than
	all other objects at an identical distance. Our results suggest a
	novel mechanism for depth perception that can be achieved with a

	modulate strongly during both frontal pursuit and vergence tracking,

	the bat by providing it with information that it uses to make an
	attack decision (aposematism) or they may disorient the bat by interrupting
	the normal flow of echo information required to complete a successful
	capture (startle, jamming). At what point during a bat's attack does
	an arctiid emit its clicks? If the sounds are aposematic, the moth
	should emit them early in the attack echolocation sequence in order
	to allow the bat time to understand their meaning. If, however, the
	sounds disrupt the bat's echo-processing behaviour, one would expect
	them to be emitted later in the attack to maximize their confusion
	effects. To test this, we exposed dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera)
	to a recording of the echolocation sequence emitted by a big brown
	bat (Eptesicus fuscus) as it attacked a stationary target. Our results
	demonstrate that, at normal echolocation intensities, C. tenera does
	not respond to approach calls but waits until the terminal phase
	of the attack before emitting its clicks. This timing is evident
	whether the moth is stationary or flying and is largely independent
	of the intensity of the echolocation calls. These results support
	the hypothesis of a jamming effect (e.g. 'phantom echoes') and suggest
	that, to determine experimentally the effects of arctiid clicks on
	bats, it is important that the bats be tested under conditions that
	simulate the natural context in which this defence operates.},

	arranged in an essentially unique matter. Here we apply analogous
	arguments to myriapod CPGs. Analyses based on symmetry applied to
	these networks lead to testable predictions, including a distinction
	between primary and secondary gaits, the existence of a new primary
	gait called 'jump', and the occurrence of half-integer wave numbers
	in myriapod gaits. For bipeds, our analysis also predicts two gaits
	with the out-of-phase symmetry of the walk and two gaits with the
	in-phase symmetry of the hop. We present data that support each of
	these predictions. This work suggests that symmetry can be used to
	infer a plausible class of CPG network architectures from observed
	patterns of animal gaits.},

	field potentials related to the motor command occur later in the
	precommand nucleus than in the command nucleus, suggesting that they
	are a corollary rather than a cause of electromotor command initiation.
	Recorded extracellularly, certain precommand nucleus units fire spontaneously
	between electromotor commands but pause briefly following each command;
	others units fire a burst of spikes only during the post-command
	pause. The firing frequency of the former is correlated with the
	duration of the interval between successive electromotor commands
	when the fish is discharging at more than approximately 5 Hz. The
	post-command pause in spontaneous firing is due to corollary-discharge-mediated
	feedback inhibition, probably generated by the activity of the bursting
	units that fire only during this period. Precommand nucleus neurons
	are activated by electrosensory input, and stimulation of the precommand
	nucleus modulates the endogenous pattern of electromotor command.
	We propose that the irregular rhythm of the motor command depends
	largely on the integration of descending information of various origins,
	conveyed via the precommand nucleus to the command nucleus, and that
	this process is regulated by corollary discharge feedback inhibition
	to the precommand nucleus.},

	The present study was undertaken in order to test if the Filehne

	Filehne illusion was measured in eight subjects by determining the
	amount of external background motion required to compensate for the
	illusory background motion induced by 12 deg/sec rightward smooth
	pursuit. Using a two-alternative forced-choice method, test trials,
	which yielded the estimate of the Filehne illusion, were randomly
	interleaved with conditioning trials, in which high retinal image
	slip was created by background stimuli moving at a constant horizontal
	velocity. There was a highly reproducible monotic relationship between
	the size and direction of the Filehne illusion and the velocity of
	the background stimulus in the conditioning trials with the following
	extremes: large Filehne illusions with illusory motion to the right
	occurred for conditioning stimuli moving to the left, i.e. opposite
	to the direction of eye movement in the test trials, while conversely,
	conditioning stimuli moving to the right yielded Filehne illusions
	close to zero. Additional controls suggest that passive motion aftereffects
	are unlikely to account for the modulation of the Filehne illusion
	by the conditioning stimulus. We hypothesize that this modification
	might reflect the dynamic character of the networks elaborating spatial
	constancy.},

  abstract = {Neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo are subject to an intense synaptic
	background activity but little is known of how this activity affects
	cellular responsiveness and what function it may serve. These issues
	were examined in morphologically reconstructed neocortical pyramidal
	neurons in which synaptic background activity was simulated based
	on recent measurements in cat parietal cortex. We show that background
	activity can be decomposed into two components: a tonically active
	conductance and voltage fluctuations. Previous studies have mostly
	focused on the conductance effect, revealing that background activity
	is responsible for a decrease in responsiveness, which imposes severe
	conditions of coincidence of inputs necessary to discharge the cell.
	It is shown here, in contrast, that responsiveness is enhanced if
	voltage fluctuations are taken into account; in this case the model
	can produce responses to inputs that would normally be subthreshold.
	This effect is analyzed by dissecting and comparing the different
	components of background activity, as well as by evaluating the contribution
	of parameters such as the dendritic morphology, the distribution
	of leak currents, the value of axial resistivity, the densities of
	voltage-dependent currents, and the release parameters underlying
	background activity. Interestingly, the model's optimal responsiveness
	was obtained when voltage fluctuations were of the same order as
	those measured intracellularly in vivo. Possible consequences were
	also investigated at the population level, where the presence of
	background activity allowed networks of pyramidal neurons to instantaneously
	detect inputs that are small compared with the classical detection
	threshold. These results suggest, at the single-cell level, that
	the presence of voltage fluctuations has a determining influence
	on cellular responsiveness and that these should be taken into account
	in models of background activity. At the network level, we predict
	that background activity provides the necessary drive for detecting
	events that would normally be undetectable. Experiments are suggested
	to explore this possible functional role for background activity.},

  abstract = {In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate
	cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit
	responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most
	effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the
	most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive
	stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of
	the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small
	spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed
	that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on'
	centre and an 'off' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off'
	areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic,
	and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective
	than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler,
	1957). In the freely moving light-adapted cat it was found that the
	great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response
	to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas
	small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk
	responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger
	responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave
	moreactivation for one direction than for the opposite. The present
	investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive
	fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of
	the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory
	and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled
	retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement
	of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric
	pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate
	responses to moving stimuli with receptive field arrangements. Some
	cells could be activated from either eye, and in these binocular
	interaction was studied.},

	the investigation of the neuronal activity underlying the execution
	of slow eye movements, offer an excellent opportunity to study higher
	brain functions such as motion processing, sensorimotor integration,
	and predictive mechanisms as well as neuronal plasticity andmotor
	learning. As an example, since there exists a tight connection between
	the execution of slow eye movements and the processing of any kind
	of motion, these eye movements can be used as a biological, behavioural
	probe for the neuronal processing of motion. Global visual motion
	elicits optokinetic nystagmus, acting as a visual gaze stabilization
	system. The underlying neuronal substrate consists mainly of the
	cortico-pretecto-olivo-cerebellar pathway. Additionally, another
	gaze stabilization system depends on the vestibular input known as
	the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The interactions between the visual
	and vestibular stabilization system are essential to fulfil the plasticity
	of the vestibulo-ocular reflex representing a simple form of learning.
	Local visual motion is a necessary prerequisite for the execution
	of smooth pursuit eye movements which depend on the cortico-pontino-cerebeilar
	pathway. In the wake of saccades, short-latency eye movements can
	be elicited by brief movements of the visual scene. Finally, eye
	movements directed to objects in different planes of depth consist
	of slow movements also. Although there is some overlap in the neuronal
	substrates underlying these different types of slow eye movements,

	We recorded from 101 neurons (all directionally selective) in four
	NOT/DTN of three trained and behaving rhesus monkeys. Neuronal activity
	increased when stimuli moved ipsiversively with respect to the recording
	site and decreased below spontaneous activity when stimuli moved
	contraversively. While the monkey fixated a small spot, some NOT/DTN
	neurons did not respond at all to the retinal image slip of a whole-field
	random dot pattern; others showed a monotonic increase of activity
	to increasing velocities of that stimulus. The velocity range tested
	was up to 100 degrees/s. During the execution of optokinetic nystagmus,
	39 of 73 cells tested showed a velocity-tuned response with an average
	optimum at 21 degrees/s retinal image slip. Following saccades during
	optokinetic nystagmus (quick phases), the NOT/DTN neuronal activity
	briefly attained the level of spontaneous activity, as predicted
	from the velocity selectivity during optokinetic nystagmus. Immediately
	upon cessation of optokinetic stimulation in the preferred direction,
	NOT/DTN activity returned to the spontaneous level and did not reflect
	the ongoing optokinetic afternystagmus in darkness. Most NOT/DTN
	neurons displayed direction selectivity also during smooth pursuit.
	Twenty-one of 50 cells tested (42%) always responded to the retinal
	slip of the target (target velocity cells), 16 cells (32%) responded
	to the retinal slip of the background (background velocity cells),
	and 13 cells (26%) did not respond at all during smooth pursuit.
	We conclude from our results that the NOT/DTN is an essential structure
	for the processing of the direction and speed of retinal image slip.
	This information is then used for the generation and maintenance
	of slow eye movements, preferentially during horizontal optokinetic
	nystagmus but also during pursuit eye movements.},

	the presence of a moving target, it has been difficult to attribute
	the neuronal activity observed during the execution of these eye
	movements to either sensory processing or to motor preparation or
	execution. Previously, we showed that rhesus monkeys can be trained
	to perform SPEM directed toward an "imaginary" target defined by
	visual cues confined to the periphery of the visual field. The pursuit
	of an "imaginary" target provides the opportunity to elicit SPEM
	without stimulating visual receptive fields confined to the center
	of the visual field. Here, we report that a subset of neurons [85
	"imaginary" visual tracking (iVT)-neurons] in area MST of 3 rhesus
	monkeys were identically activated during pursuit of a conventional,
	foveal dot target and the "imaginary" target. Because iVT-neurons
	did not respond to the presentation of a moving "imaginary" target
	during fixation of a stationary dot, we are able to exclude that
	responses to pursuit of the "imaginary" target were artifacts of
	stimulation of the visual field periphery. Neurons recorded from
	the representation of the central parts of the visual field in neighboring
	area MT, usually vigorously discharging during pursuit of foveal
	targets, in no case responded to pursuit of the "imaginary" target.
	This dissociation between MT and MST neurons supports the view that
	pursuit responses of MT neurons are the result of target image motion,
	whereas those of iVT-neurons in area MST reflect an eye movement-related
	signal that is nonretinal in origin. iVT-neurons fell into two groups,
	depending on the properties of the eye movement-related signal. Whereas
	most of them (71%) encoded eye velocity, a minority showed responses
	determined by eye position, irrespective of whether eye position
	was changed by smooth pursuit or by saccades. Only the former group
	exhibited responses that led the eye movement, which is a prerequisite
	for a causal role in the generation of SPEM.},

  abstract = {Retinal image slip can result from an eye movement across a stationary
	object or alternatively from motion of the object while the eyes
	are stationary. The ability to discriminate between these two kinds
	of retinal image slip is necessary for the perception of a stable
	visual world. In order to determine if this ability is already present
	in monkey visual area V1, we asked if single V1 units are able to
	differentiate between externally and self-induced retinal image slip.
	Externally induced retinal image slip was realized in the 'object
	motion' condition (OMC) by moving a behaviourally irrelevant visual
	stimulus ('object': a bar or a large random dot pattern) across the
	receptive field while the monkey fixated a small, stationary target.
	Conversely, self-induced retinal image slip of comparable size was
	evoked in the 'ego motion' condition (EMC) by asking the monkey to
	pursue the target, moving at the speed of the object in the OMC,
	while the object was kept stationary. We recorded 221 units from
	visual area V1, 51, (23%) of them directionally selective, and compared
	their responses to self-induced and externally induced retinal image
	slip. Many of them seemed to give some preference to externally induced
	retinal image slip. However, on closer examination it became clear
	that this seeming preference could be attributed to the fact that
	oculomotor performance was less precise in the EMC than in the OMC,
	causing a larger deviation from the optimal retinal image trajectory
	in the EMC. We show that the impact of eye position errors can be
	eliminated by the use of a position-invariant stimulus, such as large-field
	random dot patterns. We then show that the impact of both eye position
	errors and deviation of eye velocity from target velocity in the
	EMC can be eliminated by moving the stimulus in a given OMC trial
	according to an inverted replica of the eye movement trajectory in
	the preceding EMC trial, guaranteeing identical retinal stimulation
	in the OMC and the EMC. If identical retinal stimulation was ensured,
	none of the V1 units tested was able to differentiate between externally
	and self-induced retinal image slip. We conclude that V1 does not
	contribute to the perception of a world which is stable despite eye
	movements.},

	were represented over expanded cortical areas. 2) Most of the cutaneous
	receptive fields recorded within these expanded cortical representational
	zones were unusually small. 3) The internal topography of representation
	of the stimulated and immediately surrounding skin surfaces differed
	greatly from that recorded in control experiments. Representational
	discontinuities emerged in this map region, and "hypercolumn" distances
	in this map sector were grossly abnormal. 4) Borders between the
	representations of individual digits and digit segments commonly
	shifted. 5) The functionally defined rostral border of area 3b shifted
	farther rostralward, manifesting either an expansion of the cutaneous
	area 3b fingertip representation into cortical field 3a or an emergence
	of a cutaneous input zone in the caudal aspect of this normally predominantly
	deep-receptor representational field. 6) Significant lateralward
	translocations of the borders between the representations of the

	in some cases the areas or magnifications--of representations of
	many skin surfaces not directly involved in the trained behavior
	also changed significantly. However, the most striking areal, positional,
	and topographic changes were related to the representations of the

	in the tectum of the goldfish which discharge only during eye movement.
	Their activity was not simply related either to the motor command
	causing the movement or to the resulting sensory input. We tentatively
	identified the information they transmit as 'efference copy', using
	a concept which was formulated by von Holst and Mittelstaedt (1950)
	to account for suppression of the optokinetic reflex during voluntary
	eye movements. The neurones were first encountered as a burst of
	electrical activity in the tectal commissure which occurred in time
	with spontaneous saccadic movements of the eyes. Their discharge
	patterns were analysed as completely as was possible using the summed
	electrical activity generated by the synchronous firing of several
	axons. Single units can also be recorded in the tectal commissure
	but most of them are visual units which are sensitive to light levels
	in the experimental room. They show no response to eye movement alone.
	They fire rhythmically and continuously in the dark and usually are
	inhibited by light (Mark & Davidson, 1966). A detailed study of their
	properties has not yet been made. We have now recorded with a micro-electrode
	in the tectal commissure units whose activity is not affected by
	light and whose periodic discharge corresponds to eye movements and
	to the bursts of summed activity recorded by a less selective electrode.
	The firing patterns of these neurones, which we have named efference
	copy neurones, are described in this paper. A preliminary account
	of this work has appeared elsewhere (Johnstone & Mark, 19696).},

	operations in pursuit eye movements, learning and vector-averaging,
	to gain insight into their underlying coordinate frameworks and their
	sequence in sensory-motor processing. Learning was induced in the
	initiation of pursuit eye movements by targets that moved initially
	at one speed for 100 msec and then increased or decreased to a sustained
	final speed. Vector averaging was studied by comparing the initial
	eye acceleration evoked by the simultaneous motion of two targets
	with that evoked by each target singly. Learning caused specific
	effects on the direction of the vector-averaged responses to two-target
	stimuli that included one target moving in the direction used to
	induce learning. Learned increases or decreases in eye acceleration
	caused the direction of the responses to two-targets to rotate toward
	or away from the learning direction. Learning also caused nonspecific
	changes in the responses to two-target stimuli. After any learning
	protocol, two-target responses usually became smaller, and their
	directions rotated away from the axis of the target motion used for
	learning. Quantitative analysis showed that the specific effects
	of learning were predicted most closely by a model in which vector
	averaging occurs downstream from the site(s) of learning. We suggest
	that the pursuit system creates parallel commands for potential movements
	to each of the targets in two-target stimuli, and that learning occurs

	advances in radio frequency technology make it possible to measure

	has tremendous benefit since line of sight is not required between
	the beacons and the transponder, and because the data association
	problem can be completely avoided. If the positions of the beacons
	are known, measurements from multiple beacons can be combined using
	probability grids to provide an accurate estimate of robot location.
	This estimate can be improved by using Monte Carlo techniques and

	be used to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem
	(SLAM) when beacon locations are uncertain. Experimental results

	that the animals compensated to hold the echo (reference) frequency
	at a value that was slightly higher than the resting frequency and
	slightly lower than the cochlear resonance frequency; (4) that reference
	frequency varied as a function of velocity, the higher the velocity
	of the animal, the higher was the reference frequency (slope 55 Hz

	a sensitive period that lasts until the approach of adulthood. Neurophysiological
	techniques have been used to determine underlying sites of plasticity

	is a major site of plasticity. Experience during the sensitive period
	can cause large-scale, adaptive changes in the tuning of ICX neurons
	for sound localization cues. Large-scale physiological changes are
	accompanied by anatomical remodeling of afferent axons to the ICX.
	Changes in the tuning of ICX neurons for cue values involve two stages:
	(1) the instructed acquisition of neuronal responses to novel cue
	values and (2) the elimination of responses to inappropriate cue
	values. Newly acquired neuronal responses depend differentially on
	NMDA receptor currents for their expression. A model is presented

  abstract = {The goal of research into brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is to build
	communication and control systems that a person can use to interact
	with the environment without the need for muscular or peripheral
	neural activity. The principal application of a BCI is as a form
	of neural prosthesis for people suffering from severe paralyzing
	conditions which can be caused by, for example, Amyotrophic Lateral
	Sclerosis (ALS). Currently the most successful approaches to patient
	BCI are still those in which the user rather than the computer has
	to do most of the learning, and this usually takes many weeks or
	months in practice. If machine learning (ML) algorithms can be integrated
	effectively into such systems, they oN.er the possibility of faster
	identification of the approach that is most suitable for a given
	patient. Thus ML has the potential to reduce the training time for
	a patient from several weeks or months to a few days or hours. Most
	BCIs using ML techniques require a data collection phase during which
	the subject repeatedly executes a training task which is reflected
	by brain signals at clearly separable locations. Algorithms like
	Support Vector Machine learning or Fisher Discriminant Analysis can
	be applied to infer a classifying function from the collected training
	data. This function can then be used in online applications to identify
	different brain states produced by the subject. For practical reasons,
	the number of data points collected in experiments are usually very
	small but show many dimensions. This is a typical scenario in which
	feature selection methods may improve learnability. State-of-the-art
	embedded feature selection methods are discussed along a novel, unifying
	theoretical framework. The majority of BCIs are based on extracranial
	electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during motor imagery, however
	due to the filter properties of the skull the signal-to-noise ratio
	of the EEG is very limited. This could be one reason why a successful
	BCI for completely paralyzed patients has not yet been designed to
	date. The aim of this thesis is use the advantage of both state-of-the-art
	machine learning techniques as well as advanced brain imaging techniques
	to make a step towards a patient brain-computer interface. Based
	on an imagery task, we introduce a novel BCI that utilizes Recursive
	Feature Elimination (RFE), a feature selection method which was adapted
	to the special case of brain imaging data, and a regularized Support
	Vector Machine (SVM). This BCI was designed and tested based on EEG-recordings.
	Together with our collaborators from the department Medical Psychology
	and Behavioral Neurobiology at the university of Tuebingen (Prof.
	Dr. N. Birbaumer), we investigated whether the invasive recording
	technique ECoG might be a viable alternative for the completely paralyzed.
	As a first step our BCI was successfully tested in epilepsy patients
	who had temporary electrode implants. After the "proof of concept"
	was made, the first completely paralyzed patient suffering from ALS
	was implanted. Unfortunately, we cannot not yet use a BCI to communicate
	with the patient. The second part of the thesis follows an approach
	based on the recording technique magnetoencephalography (MEG) to
	provide a BCI to paralyzed patients. Although an MEG device is currently
	too expensive and too large to be installed at a patient&lsquo;s
	home, its |compared to EEG| superior signal-to-noise ratio might
	help to design a patient BCI. Due to the better data quality, patients
	whose brain signals are not classifiable using EEG might be classifiable
	using MEG. In this case a classifying function can be inferred from
	the MEG-recordings. This function could then be used to provide feed-
	back which encourages the patient to produce more separable brain
	signals. One hypothesis is that the brain signals of a patient who
	was trained in this way later become classifiable using a portable
	and affordable EEG system. Since MEG has never been used before for
	feedback experiments, the first challenge was to get real-time ac-
	cess to MEG data. We were then ready to run an experiment with ten
	healthy subjects of whom 4 wrote a short name using imagination tasks
	only. It turned out that our hypothesis was supported by the fact
	that shorter training times are required as compared to an EEG-based
	approach.},

  abstract = {We studied the effects of various patterns as contextual stimuli on
	human orientation discrimination, and on responses of neurons in
	V1 of alert monkeys. When a target line is presented along with various
	contextual stimuli (masks), human orientation discrimination is impaired.
	For most V1 neurons, responses elicited by a line in the receptive
	field (RF) center are suppressed by these contextual patterns. Orientation
	discrimination thresholds of human observers are elevated slightly
	when the target line is surrounded by orthogonal lines. For randomly
	oriented lines, thresholds are elevated further and even more so
	for lines parallel to the target. Correspondingly, responses of most
	V1 neurons to a line are suppressed. Although contextual lines inhibit
	the amplitude of orientation tuning functions of most V1 neurons,
	they do not systematically alter the tuning width. Elevation of human
	orientation discrimination thresholds decreases with increasing curvature
	of masking lines, so does the inhibition of V1 neuronal responses.
	A mask made of straight lines yields the strongest interference with
	human orientation discrimination and produces the strongest suppression
	of neuronal responses. Elevation of human orientation discrimination
	thresholds is highest when a mask covers only the immediate vicinity
	of the target line. Increasing the masking area results in less interference.
	On the contrary, suppression of neuronal responses in V1 increases
	with increasing mask size. Our data imply that contextual interference
	observed in human orientation discrimination is in part directly
	related to contextual inhibition of neuronal activity in V1. However,
	the finding that interference with orientation discrimination is
	weaker for larger masks suggests a figure-ground segregation process
	that is not located in V1.},

	we show that neither the eye movement-induced retinal image motion

  abstract = {Since normal human subjects can perform smooth-pursuit eye movements
	only in the presence of a moving target, the occurrence of these
	eye movements represents an ideal behavioural probe to monitor the
	successful processing of visual motion. It has been shown previously
	that subjects can execute smooth-pursuit eye movements to targets
	defined by luminance and colour, the first-order stimulus attributes,
	as well as to targets defined by derived, second-order stimulus attributes
	such as contrast, flicker or motion. In contrast to these earlier
	experiments focusing on steady-state pursuit, the present study addressed
	the course of pre-saccadic pursuit initiation (less than 100 ms),
	as this early time period is thought to represent open-loop pursuit,
	i.e. the eye movements are exclusively driven by visual inputs proceeding
	the onset of the eye movement itself. Eye movements of five human
	subjects tracking first- and second-order motion stimuli had been
	measured. The analysis of the obtained eye traces revealed that smooth-pursuit
	eye movements could be initiated to first-order as well as second-order
	motion stimuli, even before the execution of the first initial saccade.
	In contrast to steady-state pursuit, the initiation of pursuit was
	not exclusively determined by the movement of the target, but rather
	due to an interaction between dominant first-order and less-weighted
	second-order motion components. Based on our results, two conclusions
	may be drawn: first and specific for initiation of smooth-pursuit
	eye movements, we present evidence supporting the notion that initiation
	of pursuit reflects integration of all available visual motion information.
	Second and more general, our results further support the hypothesis
	that the visual system consists of more than one mechanism for the
	extraction of first-order and second-order motion.},

	seals (Phoca vitulina) and of the follicle crypts on the rostrum
	of the dolphin Sotalia fluviatilis guianensis were measured using
	an infrared imaging system. Thermograms demonstrate that, in both
	species, single vibrissal follicles are clearly defined units of
	high thermal radiation, indicating a separate blood supply to these
	cutaneous structures. It is suggested that the high surface temperatures
	measured in the area of the mouth of the follicles is a function
	of the sinus system. In seals and dolphins, surface temperature gradually
	decreased with increasing distance from the centre of a follicle,
	indicating heat conduction from the sinus system via the follicle
	capsule to adjacent tissues. It is suggested that the follicular
	sinus system is a thermoregulatory structure responsible for the
	maintenance of high tactile sensitivity at the extremely low ambient
	temperatures demonstrated for the vibrissal system of seals. The
	vibrissal follicles of odontocetes have been described as vestigial
	structures, but the thermograms obtained in the present study provide
	the first evidence that, in Sotalia fluviatilis, the follicles possess
	a well-developed sinus system, suggesting that they are part of a
	functional mechanosensory system.},

  abstract = {The ocular following responses elicited by brief unexpected movements
	of the visual scene were studied in 10 rhesus monkeys. Test patterns
	were either random dots or sine-wave gratings [spatial frequency
	(Fs) 0.046-1.06 cycles per degree (c/degree)]. Test stimuli were
	velocity steps [speed (V) 5-400 degrees/s] of 100-ms duration, applied
	50 ms after spontaneous saccades to avoid saccadic intrusions. Eye
	velocity response profiles were nonmonotonic and idiosyncratic, but
	consistent and closely time-locked to stimulus onset. Two measures
	of response amplitude were used: initial peak in eye velocity (ei),
	and average final eye velocity over the period of 110-140 ms measured
	from stimulus onset (ef). Using random dot patterns, response latencies
	were short, e.g., when the criterion for onset was an eye acceleration
	of 100 degrees/s2, mean latency (+/- SE) for eight monkeys with a
	40 degrees/s test ramp was 51.5 +/- 0.6 ms. Using gratings of low
	spatial frequency (Fs less than 0.5 c/degree), latency was inversely
	related to, and solely a function of, contrast and temporal frequency,
	Ft (where Ft = V X Fs). We conclude from the latter that ocular following
	is triggered by local changes in luminance, and propose a model of
	the detection mechanism that reproduces all the essential features
	of these data. Moderate low-pass spatial filtering ("blurring") of
	the random dot pattern, by interposing a sheet of ground glass between
	the animal and the scene, progressively increased the response latency
	and decreased ef, but ei was either little affected or increased.
	When used with gratings, the ground glass simply reduced the contrast
	(range: 0.5-0.003), with very similar consequences for ocular following:
	latency increased and ef decreased, but ei changed little over the
	first decade of contrast reduction, increased over the second, and
	began to show attenuation (often pronounced) only at the lowest contrast.
	We suggest that these anomalous increases in ei with reductions in
	contrast are secondary to the delay in response onset and might be
	explained if the motion detectors responsible for triggering ocular
	following act as a gate for integrated retinal slip inputs to the
	tracking system proper: the delay in detection causes a buildup in
	the error signal driving the tracking response. En masse movement
	of the visual field was not the optimal stimulus for ocular following.(ABSTRACT

	two fundamental problems: discriminating between self-generated and
	external auditory signals and preventing desensitization. In humans
	[1] and many other vertebrates [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], auditory neurons
	in the brain are inhibited during vocalization but little is known
	about the nature of the inhibition. Here we show, using intracellular
	recordings of auditory neurons in the singing cricket, that presynaptic
	inhibition of auditory afferents and postsynaptic inhibition of an
	identified auditory interneuron occur in phase with the song pattern.
	Presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition persist in a fictively singing,
	isolated cricket central nervous system and are therefore the result
	of a corollary discharge from the singing motor network. Mimicking
	inhibition in the interneuron by injecting hyperpolarizing current
	suppresses its spiking response to a 100-dB sound pressure level
	(SPL) acoustic stimulus and maintains its response to subsequent,
	quieter stimuli. Inhibition by the corollary discharge reduces the
	neural response to self-generated sound and protects the cricket's
	auditory pathway from self-induced desensitization.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic
	approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increasing
	attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade,
	and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment
	of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning.
	The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers
	and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book
	deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and
	classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety
	of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties
	discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and
	a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques
	from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector
	machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance
	vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning
	curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation
	methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
	contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets
	are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background
	and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

  abstract = {During activated states, neocortical neurons receive intense synaptic
	background activity that induces large-amplitude membrane potential
	fluctuations and a strong conductance in the membrane. However, little
	is known about the integrative properties of neurons during such
	high-conductance states. Here we investigated the integrative properties
	of neocortical pyramidal neurons under in vivo conditions simulated
	by computational models. We show that the presence of high-conductance
	fluctuations induces a stochastic state in which active dendrites
	are fast conducting and have a different dynamics of initiation and
	forward-propagation of Na+-dependent spikes. Synaptic efficacy, quantified
	as the probability that a synaptic input specifically evokes a somatic
	spike, was approximately independent of the dendritic location of
	the synapse. Synaptic inputs evoked precisely timed responses (milliseconds),
	which also showed a reduced location dependence. This scheme was
	found to apply to a broad range of kinetics and density distributions
	of voltage-dependent conductances, as well as to different dendritic
	morphologies. Synaptic efficacies were, however, modulable by the
	balance of excitation and inhibition in background activity, for
	all synapses at once. Thus, models predict that the intense synaptic
	activity in vivo can confer advantageous computational properties
	to neocortical neurons: they can be set to an integrative mode that
	is stochastic, fast conducting, and optimized to process synaptic
	inputs at high temporal resolution independently of their position
	in the dendrites. Some of these predictions can be tested experimentally.},

  abstract = {The brain maintains the accuracy of saccadic eye movements by adjusting
	saccadic amplitude relative to the target distance (i.e., saccade
	gain) on the basis of the performance of recent saccades. If an experimenter
	surreptitiously moves the target backward during each saccade, thereby
	causing the eyes to land beyond their targets, saccades undergo a
	gradual gain reduction. The error signal driving this conventional
	saccadic gain adaptation could be either visual (the postsaccadic
	distance of the target from the fovea) or motoric (the direction
	and size of the corrective saccade that brings the eye onto the back-stepped
	target). Similarly, the adaptation itself might be a motor adjustment
	(change in the size of saccade for a given perceived target distance)
	or a visual remapping (change in the perceived target distance).
	We studied these possibilities in experiments both with rhesus macaques
	and with humans. To test whether the error signal is motoric, we
	used a paradigm devised by Heiner Deubel. The Deubel paradigm differed
	from the conventional adaptation paradigm in that the backward step
	that occurred during the saccade was brief, and the target then returned
	to its original displaced location. This ploy replaced most of the
	usual backward corrective saccades with forward ones. Nevertheless,
	saccadic gain gradually decreased over hundreds of trials. Therefore,
	we conclude that the direction of saccadic gain adaptation is not
	determined by the direction of corrective saccades. To test whether
	gain adaptation is a manifestation of a static visual remapping,
	we decreased the gain of 10NBN0 horizontal saccades by conventional
	adaptation and then tested the gain to targets appearing at retinal
	locations unused during adaptation. To make the target appear in
	such "virgin territory," we had it jump first vertically and then
	10NBN0 horizontally; both jumps were completed and the target spot
	extinguished before saccades were made sequentially to the remembered
	target locations. Conventional adaptation decreased the gain of the
	second, horizontal saccade even though the target was in a nonadapted
	retinal location. In contrast, the horizontal component of oblique
	saccades made directly to the same virgin location showed much less
	gain decrease, suggesting that the adaptation is specific to saccade
	direction rather than to target location. Thus visual remapping cannot
	account for the entire reduction of saccadic gain. We conclude that
	saccadic gain adaptation involves an error signal that is primarily
	visual, not motor, but that the adaptation itself is primarily motor,
	not visual.},

  abstract = {Many animals use tools, but their understanding of physical forces
	or causal relations is unclear (1, 2). Primates are considered the
	most versatile and complex tool users, but observations of New Caledonian
	crows (Corvus moneduloides) raise the possibility that these birds
	may rival nonhuman primates in tool-related cognitive capabilities.
	We report here an experiment inspired by the observation that a captive
	female spontaneously bent a piece of straight wire into a hook and
	successfully used it to lift a bucket containing food from a vertical
	pipe (Fig. 1A). This occurred on the fifth trial of an experiment
	in which the crows had to choose between a hooked and a straight
	wire and only after the hooked wire had been removed by the other
	subject (a male). The animals had prior experience with the apparatus,
	but their only previous experience with pliant material was 1 hour
	of free manipulation with flexible pipe-cleaners a year before this
	experiment, and they were not familiar with wire (6).},

	linear models in learning. Minimization of such a quantity has many
	uses in a machine learning context: for variable or feature selection,
	minimizing training error and ensuring sparsity in solutions. We
	derive a simple but practical method for achieving these goals and
	discuss its relationship to existing techniques of minimizing the
	zero-norm. The method boils down to implementing a simple modification
	of vanilla SVM, namely via an iterative multiplicative rescaling
	of the training data. Applications we investigate which aid our discussion
	include variable and feature selection on biological microarray data,
	and multicategory classification.},

  abstract = {Voluntary attention is the top-down selection process that focuses
	cortical processing resources on the most relevant sensory information.
	Spatial attentional that is, selection based on stimulus positional
	alters neuronal responsiveness throughout primate visual cortex.
	It has been hypothesized that it also changes receptive field profiles
	by shifting their centers toward attended locations and by shrinking
	them around attended stimuli. Here we examined, at high resolution,
	receptive fields in cortical area MT of rhesus macaque monkeys when
	their attention was directed to different locations within and outside
	these receptive fields. We found a shift of receptive fields, even
	far from the current location of attention, accompanied by a small
	amount of shrinkage. Thus, already in early extrastriate cortex,
	receptive fields are not static entities but are highly modifiable,
	enabling the dynamic allocation of processing resources to attended
	locations and supporting enhanced perception within the focus of
	attention by effectively increasing the local cortical magnification.},

The 25 revised full papers presented were carefully selected during two rounds of reviewing and improvement from about 50 submissions. The papers reflect the concepts of three challenges dealt with in the workshop: finding an assessment base on the uncertainty of predictions using classical statistics, Bayesian inference, and statistical learning theory; the second challenge was to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes; the third challenge of recognizing textual entailment addresses semantic analysis of language to form a generic framework for applied semantic inference in text understanding.},
